== Flixter

A Ruby on Rails web application modeled after online course platforms such as Coursera and Udemy. This app was created during my time with The Firehose Project in order to demonstrate the following features:

* User authentication using the Devise gem
* Online payment integration via Stripe
* Image and video uploads hosted by AWS
* Course creation with related sections containing lessons
* Course enrollment and management
